# A TCPCopy Module for MySQL Session Replay

The `mysql-sgt-replay-module` is a TCPCopy extension designed to replay MySQL sessions, enabling realistic testing of MySQL applications.

For detailed information, please consult [TCPCopy](https://github.com/session-replay-tools/tcpcopy) before proceeding.

## Installation

### Installing `intercept` on the Assistant Server

1. git clone git://github.com/session-replay-tools/intercept.git
2. cd intercept
3. ./configure 
4. make
5. make install

### Installing `tcpcopy` on the Online Server

1. git clone git://github.com/session-replay-tools/tcpcopy.git
2. cd tcpcopy
3. git clone git://github.com/session-replay-tools/mysql-sgt-replay-module.git
4. ./configure --set-protocol-module=mysql-sgt-replay-module
5. make
6. make install

## Usage Guide

### 1. **On the Target Server Running MySQL Applications:**

a) Configure Routing to Direct Response Packets to the Assistant Server

For example, assuming `10.110.12.18` is the IP address of the assistant server and `10.110.12.15` is the MySQL client IP address, use the following route command to direct all responses from `10.110.12.15` to the assistant server:

`route add -host 10.110.12.15 gw 10.110.12.18`

b) Start MySQL with `--skip-grant-tables`

### 2. **On the Assistant Server Running `intercept` (Root Privilege or CAP_NET_RAW Capability Required):**

  `./intercept -F <filter> -i <device>`

Note that the filter format is the same as the pcap filter. For example:

   `./intercept -i eth0 -F 'tcp and src port 3306' -d`

In this example, `intercept` will capture response packets from a TCP-based application listening on port 3306, using the eth0 network device.

Please note that `ip_forward` is not enabled on the assistant server.

### 3) **On the Online Source Server (Root Privilege or CAP_NET_RAW Capability Required):**

`./tcpcopy -x localServerPort-targetServerIP:targetServerPort -s <intercept server> [-c <ip range>]`

For example (assuming 10.110.12.17 is the IP address of the target server):

`./tcpcopy -x 3306-10.110.12.17:3306 -s 10.110.12.18 -c 10.110.12.15`

`tcpcopy` captures MySQL packets (assuming MySQL listens on port 3306) on the current server and modify all client ip to 10.110.12.15, modifies them as needed, and forwards them to port 3306 on `10.110.12.17` (the target MySQL server). It also connects to `10.110.12.18` to request that `intercept` forwards the response packets to it.

## Note

1. Only the complete sesssion could be replayed
2. Currently, it does not support MySQL 8.0 yet.
